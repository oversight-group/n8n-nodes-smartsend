/**
 * Runs n8n's own community-node verification gate against this repo, locally,
 * before publishing.
 *
 * Why this exists: n8n's CLI (`npx @n8n/scan-community-package <name>`) only
 * works on an ALREADY-PUBLISHED package. It reads the npm provenance
 * attestation, downloads the attested GitHub source, and lints both that source
 * and the shipped tarball — useless as a pre-publish check. This calls the
 * scanner's analyzePackage() directly on local directories instead.
 *
 * The scanner is installed into an isolated prefix rather than as a
 * devDependency: hoisted alongside our own TypeScript it breaks, because its
 * nested ts-api-utils resolves the wrong typescript and dies with
 * "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'Intrinsic')".
 *
 * Run with:  npm run scan
 *
 * Two legs are checked, mirroring what n8n does:
 *   1. SOURCE — this working tree, standing in for the attested GitHub checkout
 *   2. DIST   — the built output, standing in for the published tarball
